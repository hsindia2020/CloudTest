 *An Enum is a special type used to define collections of constants.
 *You should always use Enums when a variable (especially a method parameter) 
 *can only take one out of a small set of possible values.
 *If you use Enums instead of integers (or String codes), 
 *you increase compile-time checking and avoid errors from passing in invalid constants, 
 *and you document which values are legal to use.
